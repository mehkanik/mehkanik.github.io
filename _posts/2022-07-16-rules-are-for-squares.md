There's a thing about writing. Rules. Loads of rules. Rules for where to put your commas, rules for how long a sentence should be, rules for rules you didn't even *know* were rules; it goes on and on. They help you make yourself a better writer! Usually. Except for when they don't. Or when they pidgeonhole you into becoming a worse writer. So when do you follow them, bend them, break them? When do you start a sentence with 'and', or 'but'? How informal can dialogue be? How many questions can I ask in a row before annoying myself?

The thing is, **it's all a fucking mystery.** I was trying to write C39 and got a fair amount of it done over a few days. But it was a slog. Just in general not very fun. Not engaging, even for me as the person writing it by and large for himself, for fun.  I sat down and asked myself what I didn't like about it. It just didn't feel right somehow, which, thank you for nothing, brain. I looked it over and figured maybe a change in perspective was needed. Not the perspective of another writer for insight, but going from third to first, against what I thought would be the best call. So, I immediately geared myself up to rewrite it. 

By immediately going and laying down. 

I ***really*** didn't want to rewrite it to begin with for fear of losing momentum (I've been in a writing rut for 3+ years until recently) let alone rewrite it in a way where I'd have to constantly write from a single character's perspective. Generally, it's frowned upon changing the narrator, hence why third person would be better. I couldn't find a reason to write the first chapter in first person, because I planned on doing away with those characters in the beginning fairly quickly.

Or so I thought. Going from third to first person, I hammered out a rewrite quickly, the setting and information flowed more smoothly, and the characters (minus the captain, sorry bub, you're still boring) just felt more alive the minute I changed the perspective. Is it a smart idea to write the story in first person instead of third? Maybe not. Will I change the narrator from time to time? Probably. Is that against ~the rules~? Also probably. However, it not only improved the first chapter, one of the most important chapters in a story, but it was just more fun. It also gives me an interesting thing to play with in that the main character will be the only one where you never see the inside of his mind,  while you get glimpses into the other characters' periodically.

After finishing the rewrite, I also had to seriously restrain myself from seeing if it was possible to put my serials on here, rather than their own individual bite-sized repos. It'd probably turn this site into a cluttered mess trying to do that. The fact I have everything working and I'm satisfied with the rewrite will suffice.
