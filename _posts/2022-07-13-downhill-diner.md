Clinking tableware, rubbery eggs, and overcooked bacon, the sounds and scents filled the air.

Two young men sat in a grungy diner at the bottom of a paved hill, where the morning rainfall flowed down the gutters and pooled at clogged storm drains. One of the two men wore a faded light blue jacket, the other man sitting across from him wearing a gray peacoat. They sat in silence until being served their meals.

Mr. Blue looked down at his meal, dry looking pancakes and greasy sausage before the waitress placed a small container of maple syrup near him. “Oh thank god,” He muttered before pouring most of its contents onto the plate of food. Mr. Gray received an ample plate of hashbrowns, ham, eggs, and toast. “You knew what the food would be like when we came here.” Mr. Gray told him as he grabbed a fork and began eating. No words were spoken between the two as they ate and sipped coffee.

“Hey, why is a pen the same as a painting?” Asked Mr. Blue, breaking their turbid silence, having outpaced Mr. Gray in terms of how fast they ate. Mr. Gray furrowed his brows and sat in silence for a few moments. “What kind of question is that supposed to be? What kind of pen?” His consternation was punctuated by a mouthful of hash browns. Mr. Blue leaned back in the slightly stained booth he was sitting in. “I don’t know, it sort of just popped into my head. Anyways,” He vigorously wiped his hands with the napkins provided on the table and then reached into his coat, drawing a pistol and promptly shooting the man seated at the counter to his left.

It took a moment for the diner’s denizens to realize what the sound of a silenced pistol was as the man fell forward into his meal, brains splattered against the employee’s side of the counter. Screams, chaos, the breaking of plates, and a fevered dash for the door. Mr. Blue put away his pistol and left a crisp twenty dollar bill on the table. “For fuck’s sake Blue, I haven’t even finished eating.” He said as he shoved a piece of toast into his mouth and the other in his pocket. “Damn it, I’m going to tell Father if you don’t– hey, wait up,” He said as he dashed out the door after him.

Well, that was a fun little piece of constrained writing. I might have these characters show up in other stories. I think they're fun.
