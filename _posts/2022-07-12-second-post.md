Well, overall, a productive start on this little project of mine. A few trips and tumbles, but overall I'm pleased with how this is coming along. If you gander over at the sidebar, you'll see I have a 'my writing' link, which would lead you to what you'd think. Any multi-chaptered story I write will be linked over there in a table of contents and will bring you to a much simpler, fiction oriented site layout. Sorts by oldest chapter first, has navigation and an easy on the eyes dark theme. It's not too shabby for how I'm basically shoehorning github repos into a fiction publishing platform. Or it could be me tricking myself into writing by way of sunk cost fallacy, but whatever. 

I think this is enough messing around with it for today, I'll work on the actual story and see if I can't get a real proper chapter up instead of janky placeholder posts. I still have to do some reworking to do on what I have of the first chapter of C39, it has a strong opening but it feels like it loses momentum pretty quickly. If I can't get it done tomorrow (and I probably won't) maybe I'll try some constrained writing and post that here instead.
