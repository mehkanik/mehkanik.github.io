Yes, hi, hello there. Welcome to the newly minted blog and hub to where I'll be sharing my writing. Now, by chance, if you took notice of the url I'm currently using, you'd ask yourself "Well, why the hell would you choose github for that?" Why indeed. You could imagine that it'd be a headache (it is/was/will continue to be) to use a place for version control and sharing code to, well, not do that at all. And that is at least *one* part of the allure to going through all the bother in the first place. 

Apart from writing, I've always liked solving puzzles or riddles, and the satisfaction of having solved the problem. So, what better than to host my writing (for free, to boot) on something I only have the most tenuous knowledge of? I don't even know what I actually did to make this work, frankly. It's way too fancy. That does bring me to the other fun part of doing things this way. Solving problems often make more problems, so the fun never ends. And on top of that, it makes you seem cool as fuck. I know approximately roughly between three to four git commands and I could show someone me publishing a simple post and BAM. They're amazed. They've never seen something so arcane and cryptic. I mean, I haven't either. Deltas resolved? No idea, but because of *me,* those deltas were resolved.

All that silliness aside, I will occasionally blog here, maybe talk about a movie I watched or a book I read. Once I get more comfortable with all this, I'll start properly adding a page where you can hop on over to various multi-chapter stories I am or plan to write. I might even do some short stories or prompt-inspired stuff here from time to time, because honestly, not much to talk about on my part. Maybe I saw a cool bug or something. Not the peak of entertainment. Either way, welcome and I hope you enjoy your stay.
