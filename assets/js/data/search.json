Rules. Loads of rules. Rules for where to put your commas, rules for how long a sentence should be, rules for rules you didn’t even know were rules; it goes on and on. They help you make yourself a better writer! Usually. Except for when they don’t. Or when they pidgeonhole you into becoming a worse writer. So when do you follow them, bend them, break them? When do you start a sentence with ‘and’, or ‘but’? How informal can dialogue be? How many questions can I ask in a row before annoying myself?The thing is, it’s all a fucking mystery. I was trying to write C39 and got a fair amount of it done over a few days. But it was a slog. Just in general not very fun. Not engaging, even for me as the person writing it by and large for himself, for fun. I sat down and asked myself what I didn’t like about it. It just didn’t feel right somehow, which for an observation, wasn’t really useful. I looked it over and figured maybe a change in perspective was needed. Not the perspective of another writer or reader for insight, but by going from third person to first. So, I geared up and got ready to do a rewrite.By immediately going and laying down.I really didn’t want to rewrite it to begin with for fear of losing momentum (I’ve been in a writing rut for 3+ years until recently) let alone rewrite it in a way where I’d have to constantly write from a single character’s perspective. Generally, it’s frowned upon changing the narrator, hence why third person would be better. I couldn’t find a reason to write the first chapter in first person, because I planned on doing away with those characters in the beginning fairly quickly.Or so I thought. Going from third to first person, I hammered out a rewrite quickly. The setting and information flowed more smoothly, and the characters just felt more alive the minute I changed the perspective. Maybe it’s not the smartest move, but it did improve the first chapter, one of the most important chapters in a story and more than anything, it was just more fun. It also gives me an interesting thing to play with in that the main character will be the only one you don’t get to see the inner workings of, while you get glimpses into the other characters’ periodically.After finishing the rewrite, I also had to seriously restrain myself from seeing if it was possible to put my serials on here, rather than their own individual bite-sized repos. It’d probably turn this site into a cluttered mess trying to do that. The fact I have everything working and I’m satisfied with the rewrite will suffice." }, { "title": "Downhill Diner", "url": "/posts/downhill-diner/", "categories": "Writing", "tags": "short story, riddle, constrained writing", "date": "2022-07-13 18:46:00 +0000", "snippet": "Clinking tableware, rubbery eggs, and overcooked bacon, the sounds and scents filled the air.Two young men sat in a grungy diner at the bottom of a paved hill, where the morning rainfall flowed down the gutters and pooled at clogged storm drains. One of the two men wore a faded light blue jacket, the other man sitting across from him wearing a gray peacoat. They sat in silence until being served their meals.Mr. Blue looked down at his meal, dry looking pancakes and greasy sausage before the waitress placed a small container of maple syrup near him. “Oh thank god,” He muttered before pouring most of its contents onto the plate of food. Mr. Gray received an ample plate of hashbrowns, ham, eggs, and toast. “You knew what the food would be like when we came here.” Mr. Gray told him as he grabbed a fork and began eating. No words were spoken between the two as they ate and sipped coffee.“Hey, why is a pen the same as a painting?” Asked Mr. Blue, breaking their turbid silence, having outpaced Mr. Gray in terms of how fast they ate. Mr. Gray furrowed his brows and sat in silence for a few moments. “What kind of question is that supposed to be? What kind of pen?” His consternation was punctuated by a mouthful of hash browns. Mr. Blue leaned back in the slightly stained booth he was sitting in. “I don’t know, it sort of just popped into my head. Anyways,” He vigorously wiped his hands with the napkins provided on the table and then reached into his coat, drawing a pistol and promptly shooting the man seated at the counter to his left.It took a moment for the diner’s denizens to realize what the sound of a silenced pistol was as the man fell forward into his meal, brains splattered against the employee’s side of the counter. Screams, chaos, the breaking of plates, and a fevered dash for the door. Mr. Blue put away his pistol and left a crisp twenty dollar bill on the table. “For fuck’s sake Blue, I haven’t even finished eating.” He said as he shoved a piece of toast into his mouth and the other in his pocket. “Damn it, I’m going to tell Father if you don’t– hey, wait up,” He said as he dashed out the door after him.Well, that was a fun little piece of constrained writing. The constraint was “a riddle without an answer”. Did you come up with one? I also might have these characters show up in other stories. I think they’re fun." }, { "title": "Hurrah, productivity", "url": "/posts/second-post/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "writing, progress", "date": "2022-07-13 01:03:00 +0000", "snippet": "Well, overall, a productive start on this little project of mine. A few trips and tumbles, but overall I’m pleased with how this is coming along. If you gander over at the sidebar, you’ll see I have a ‘my writing’ link, which would lead you to what you’d think. Any multi-chaptered story I write will be linked over there in a table of contents and will bring you to a much simpler, fiction oriented site layout. Sorts by oldest chapter first, has navigation and an easy on the eyes dark theme. It’s not too shabby for how I’m basically shoehorning github repos into a fiction publishing platform. Or it could be me tricking myself into writing by way of sunk cost fallacy, but whatever.I think this is enough messing around with it for today, I’ll work on the actual story and see if I can’t get a real proper chapter up instead of janky placeholder posts. I still have to do some reworking to do on what I have of the first chapter of C39, it has a strong opening but it feels like it loses momentum pretty quickly. If I can’t get it done tomorrow (and I probably won’t) maybe I’ll try some constrained writing and post that here instead." }, { "title": "Obligatory First Post", "url": "/posts/first-post/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "writing, blogging", "date": "2022-07-12 08:56:00 +0000", "snippet": "Yes, hi, hello there. Welcome to the newly minted blog and hub to where I’ll be sharing my writing. Now, by chance, if you took notice of the url I’m currently using, you’d ask yourself “Well, why the hell would you choose github for that?” Why indeed. You could imagine that it’d be a headache (it is/was/will continue to be) to use a place for version control and sharing code to, well, not do that at all. And that is at least one part of the allure to going through all the bother in the first place.Apart from writing, I’ve always liked solving puzzles or riddles, and the satisfaction of having solved the problem. So, what better than to host my writing (for free, to boot) on something I only have the most tenuous knowledge of? I don’t even know what I actually did to make this work, frankly. It’s way too fancy. That does bring me to the other fun part of doing things this way. Solving problems often make more problems, so the fun never ends. And on top of that, it makes you seem cool as fuck. I know approximately roughly between three to four git commands and I could show someone me publishing a simple post and BAM. They’re amazed. They’ve never seen something so arcane and cryptic. I mean, I haven’t either. Deltas resolved? No idea, but because of me, those deltas were resolved.All that silliness aside, I will occasionally blog here, maybe talk about a movie I watched or a book I read. Once I get more comfortable with all this, I’ll start properly adding a page where you can hop on over to various multi-chapter stories I am or plan to write. I might even do some short stories or prompt-inspired stuff here from time to time, because honestly, not much to talk about on my part. Maybe I saw a cool bug or something. Not the peak of entertainment. Either way, welcome and I hope you enjoy your stay." } ]
